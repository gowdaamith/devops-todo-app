Git setUP
----------
1.Initialize the Git Repository 

cd devops-todo-app
==> git init

This will crete a local git repository in your project folder 
You'll see a hidden  .git folder which will track all the things

2.Create .gitignore file

Some sensitive files should not go to the git (like virtual environment cache )
This gitignore will prevent us from pushing the sensitive files

3.Stage the file and commit the file

git add .                                              #Stages the file
git commit -m "initial commit -Flask todo app"         #Save the snapshot with a message

4.Create a Remote Repository (GitHub)

Copy the link of the remote repo adn link local repo to the github

git remote add origin https://github.com/gowdaamith/devops-todo-app.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main


This pushes your local code to github 
Now Your code is version -controlled and ready for CI/CD

                                        or

You can just create a repo and clone it to the local computer and do all these things later means after creating the repo
